    # useful month conversion:
    # month_number = "3"
    # datetime_object = datetime.datetime.strptime(month_number, "%m")
    # month_name = datetime_object.strftime("%b")
    # print(month_name)
    # OUTPUT
    # Mar
    #
    # full_month_name = datetime_object.strftime("%B")
    # print(full_month_name)
