Updating NumPy to a Specific Version
You can choose to upgrade/downgrade your NumPy to a specific version by using the command shown below in the Terminal/Anaconda prompt.

Tip - Create virtual environments, which helps us to have multiple versions of Python and its packages.

# Use either one command
conda install numpy=X.XX
pip install --upgrade numpy==X.XX
where X.XX could be one of the specific version numbers.
